# Children's Program Songs

## Deployment:

https://ethyl2.github.io/primary-presentation-2021/

### Why This Site

We wanted to have an easy way for families to access resources for learning songs that the children will be singing in a program.

### Dev Details

I wanted to keep it fairly simple, straight-forward and organized.

I used [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) for interactivity.

Icons are from [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons).
